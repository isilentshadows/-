STEP ONE: Find a page belonging to the extension you want to disable. You'll need your extension's 32-character ID to continue. If you're trying to bypass stuff, try finding it in a filter extension ID list. For further help, check the help section.

Once you have the ID, you'll be guaranteed to get to a working chrome-extension:// page by visiting the manifest file: (with your extension's ID substituted in, of course)

chrome-extension://extension_id_here_please/manifest.json
Some extensions' pages are much easier to access directly (like their options or block pages). All that's important is that you open a page belonging to the extension you want to disable.

STEP TWO: Bookmark the extension page (bookmark A) if you wish. Then, bookmark chrome://kill (B) and chrome://hang (C).

STEP THREE: While on the extension page (A), click the chrome://kill bookmark (B). The page should crash. You should already have the next step prepared.

STEP FOUR: Instantly start spamming chrome://hang (bookmark C) and quickly reload the page while spamming using the refresh key on your keyboard (or less ideally, ctrl+R). You should have reloaded within one or two seconds of killing the page.
